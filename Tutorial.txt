Creating a Node.js application involves several steps, from setting up your development environment to writing code and running your application. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a basic Node.js app:


Step 1: Install Node.js

    If you haven't already, you need to install Node.js on your computer. You can download the installer from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/). Download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for stability.

Step 2: Create a Project Directory

    Create a new directory for your Node.js project. You can do this using your computer's file explorer or by using the command line. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project:

        mkdir my-node-app
        cd my-node-app

Step 3: Initialize a Node.js Project

    Inside your project directory, you need to initialize a Node.js project. This is done using the npm init command. It will prompt you to provide information about your project (you can press Enter to accept the default values):

        npm init

Step 4: Create Your Application File

    Create the main JavaScript file for your Node.js application. Typically, this file is named index.js, but you can choose any name you like. You can create it using a text editor or use the command line:

        vi index.js

Step 5: Write Your Node.js Application

    Open index.js in your text editor and start writing your Node.js code.

Step 6: Install Dependencies (Optional)

    Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory: 

        For example: E:\Vishnu\code_task\Tutorial\my-node-app\.

    Install project dependencies by running the following command:

        npm install

    If your project requires any external packages or libraries, you can install them using npm. For example, to install the Express.js framework, you would run:

        npm install express --save

Step 7: Run Your Node.js Application

    To run your Node.js application, open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

        node index.js

    Your server should start, and you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port you specified in your code).

Step 8: Development and Testing

    You can now continue developing your Node.js application, adding routes, middleware, and more as needed. You can also use tools like Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development:

        npm install nodemon --save-dev

    This setup will automatically restart your server whenever you make changes to your code.

    Start the application using either of the following commands:

    For development with automatic server restarts:

        npm run dev
        npm start
