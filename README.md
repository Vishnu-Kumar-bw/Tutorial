Step 1: Install Node.js

    https://nodejs.org

Step 2: Create a Project Directory

    mkdir my-node-app
    cd my-node-app

Step 3: Initialize a Node.js Project, inside your project directory
    npm init

Step 4: Install Dependencies by navigate to the project's root directory: 
    For example: E:\Vishnu\code_task\Tutorial\my-node-app\.
    
    npm install

Step 5: Run Your Node.js Application

    To run your Node.js application, navigate to your project directory:
    node index.js

    Your server should start, and you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port you specified in your code).

Step 6: Development and Testing

    You can now continue developing your Node.js application, adding routes, middleware, and more as needed. You can also use tools like Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development:

    npm install nodemon --save-dev

    This setup will automatically restart your server whenever you make changes to your code.

    Start the application using either of the following commands:

    For development with automatic server restarts:

    npm run dev
    npm start
